# How to run CUDA in a Colab notebook

Develop and test high-performance CUDA applications directly within a browser, without the need for local GPU resources.

In the realm of high-performance computing, NVIDIA's GPUs like the A100 and V100 have set new benchmarks for computational speed, especially for tasks related to machine learning, data analysis, and scientific computing. Coupled with CUDA, NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model, developers can unlock dramatic performance gains by leveraging the power of these GPUs. In this article, I'll guide you through running C/C++ CUDA code in a Google Colab notebook, specifically using Nvidia A100, V100 or T4 GPUs.
